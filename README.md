A web applications with clash api

This is not thought to be a website, but only a service, then it won't be developed some frontend, only backend script.<br>
Anyway this can be used in any website if needed, and you can give it your own frontend style, as you wish.<br>
An advanced (and custom) implementation can be found [here](https://iranpalang.000webhostapp.com/en/stats.php).<br>

My implementation of this can be found [here](https://apicoc.000webhostapp.com/), where you can add your tag clan to the register, and the application will store your clan data.<br>

<strong>Note:</strong> <b>1)</b> It will take few hours to start recording, and please note that the first time you add a clan(or o new member join), it will show the actual data stored on API(and not on db), then don't be scared if you see strange numbers, it's normal.<br>
<b>2)</b> Some functions are implementated but not used yet. <b>3)</b> The Host is free, this mean that could be slow (or sometimes unavailable).
