This is not thought to be a website, but only a service, then it won't be developed some frontend, only backend script.<br>
Anyway this can be used in any website if needed, and you can give it your own frontend style, as you wish.<br>
An advanced implementation of this can be found [here](https://iranpalang.000webhostapp.com/en/stats.php).<br>
A base working implementation of this can be found [here](https://apicoc.000webhostapp.com/)

<strong>Note:</strong> some functions are implementated but not used yet.
